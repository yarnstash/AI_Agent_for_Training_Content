[Cursor right-clicks to display options]

"These options include handy narrative codes and shortcuts that can substantially streamline your work. And don't worry about space—Intapp Time allows for narratives up to 5,000 characters long."

[Screen transition to: Narrative Codes section]

"Looking to view your Narrative Codes? It's easy! Click on the Narrative Codes toolbar button or press F5. You can even access these by right-clicking and selecting 'Narrative codes' or pressing Shift+F5."

Narrator:
"Right-clicking in the Narrative field unlocks further actions like adding to the dictionary, using autocorrect, setting spelling options, and even duplicating fields from previous entries. It's all there for you to customize as you wish."

[Transition to: Narrative Field Toolbar Options]

Narrator:
"Your Narrative Field Toolbar is a powerful ally. Here, you'll discover options to add, edit, or delete narrative codes. You can also print, import, or export codes for easy sharing and management."

[Switch to: Shorthand Codes]

Narrator:
"Shorthand Codes are a real time-saver. Simply type a period, followed by the code, and then a space or punctuation mark to expand to commonly-used terms. Imagine how much quicker you'll input 'Telephone conference with' by simply typing '.TC '!"
